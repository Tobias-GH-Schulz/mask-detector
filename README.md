## About 📝
Mask Guard is a multi-model assembly that detects if your customers are wearing a mask or not and plays an alert if they are not wearing one. Mask Guard consists of CNN models that detect body and face, it is capable of image optimization and image-based distance measurement, both from camera and between objects. 

We applied our knowledge in deep learning and computer vision to create a tool that helps businesses comply with sanitary regulations. This repo contains all the parts that Mask Guard is made of.
