Just after completing the computer vision module at Strive School, three of us emabarked on this awesome project. The task was to train a model that can detect if someone is wearing a face mask or not. We took the task up several notches by including other amazing features like audio warning (in case someone forgot to wear a face mask), distance measure (a social distancing reminder), automatic brightness optimization (to brighten dark feeds from camera) amongst others. This model has been upgraded into an web application which can be accessed by everyone. In this globally trying times safety cannot be overemphasized, which is why SMBs need this model to help ensure safety and keep their businesses afloat.
